# Context
## What?
Context is a console-based text editor written in C#. It was originally designed as a<br>
simpler, non-code-focused replacement for Vim.

## Why?
This project started when I was trying to edit some code in Vim, when I realized that<br>
it just seemed too complicated, as 1) it's code focused, and 2) it has a very steep<br>
learning curve. Context is not complicated (you move around with arrow keys!), however<br>
it's similar enough to [Vim](https://www.vim.org) and [Nano](https://www.nano-editor.org) that it shouldn't<br>
be too hard to learn if you know either of those.

## How?
Context is designed in C#, and aims to not have **ANY**𑁋and I mean _**ANY**_𑁋dependencies<br>
at all. It only uses the plain Windows API.
